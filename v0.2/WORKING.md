# Working Log

## 2025-08-05 (v0.1)

*   Cloned the repository `JRF-2018/simple_synthetic_population`.
*   Created initial files: `WORKING.md`, `REPORT.md`, `infection_simulation.py`.
*   Implemented CSV data loading to create `Person` and `Family` objects.
*   Extended `Person` and `Family` classes and added a new `Organization` class.
*   Implemented `assign_organizations` function to assign individuals to schools or companies.
*   Used `numpy` to assign company sizes based on a Poisson distribution.
*   Implemented the core simulation logic with a `Simulation` class.
*   The simulation now models infection spread through organizations, families, and the community.
*   Ran a 100-day simulation and confirmed the model works as expected.
*   Created `sir.stan` to define a SIR model for analysis.
*   Implemented `analyze_with_stan` function in `infection_simulation.py` to run the Stan model using `cmdstanpy`.
*   The analysis estimates R0 and R(t) from the simulation data.
*   Generated `stan_trace.png` and `rt_plot.png` to visualize the results of the Stan analysis.
*   Implemented self-isolation logic in `infection_simulation.py`.
*   Updated `REPORT.md` to reflect the new self-isolation feature.
*   First run with isolation resulted in a very small outbreak, causing Stan model convergence issues.
*   Adjusted simulation parameters (isolation probability, community infection rate) to generate a more significant outbreak.
*   Final run executed successfully, producing a meaningful infection curve and allowing the Stan model to converge properly. Project complete.

## 2025-08-05 (v0.2)

*   **Start of v0.2 development.**
*   Read `GEMINI.md` for new requirements.
*   Plan:
    1.  Refactor school organization into classes of max 30 students.
    2.  Change simulation from daily to hourly steps.
    3.  Implement detailed daily schedules for individuals (home, work/school, commute, etc.).
    4.  Add plotting of simulation results before Stan analysis.
    5.  Temporarily disable Stan analysis.
    6.  Update `REPORT.md`.
*   Completed the refactoring of `infection_simulation.py` to an hourly model.
*   Successfully ran the simulation and generated `simulation_plot.png`.
*   Updated `REPORT.md` to reflect v0.2 changes.
*   **Re-enabled `analyze_with_stan` function.**
*   Uncommented imports and the function call.
*   Adjusted logging and initial values for compatibility with the Stan model.
*   Ran the full simulation including Stan analysis.
*   Stan analysis completed with warnings (divergent transitions), but produced `stan_trace.png` and `rt_plot.png`. This suggests the underlying simulation data may not perfectly fit a simple SIR model, which is a finding in itself.
*   **Added Stan parameter summary printout.**
*   Identified correct column names from `fit.summary()` DataFrame.
*   Corrected the code to print the summary table for `beta`, `gamma`, and `R0`.
*   **Re-implemented organization-specific infection probabilities.**
*   Modified `Organization` and `Family` classes to have distinct `internal_infection_prob` and `community_infection_prob`.
*   Updated `run_hourly_step` to model both infection pathways based on the parameters of the person's current location.
*   Temporarily commented out the `analyze_with_stan` call to verify the new simulation logic.
*   Successfully ran the simulation with the new logic.
*   **Corrected community infection logic.**
*   Modified `run_hourly_step` to calculate a dynamic `community_infection_pressure` based on the total number of non-isolated infected individuals at each time step. This ensures the community infection probability reflects the current state of the epidemic.
*   Verified the corrected logic by running the simulation again with Stan analysis disabled.
*   **Final execution.**
*   Re-enabled the `analyze_with_stan` function call.
*   Ran the complete script, which successfully executed the simulation, generated all plots (`simulation_plot.png`, `stan_trace.png`, `rt_plot.png`), and printed the final Stan parameter summary table.
